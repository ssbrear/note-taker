# Ex-Notes ![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-Green)

## Description

This project was intended to create an online list that is deployed to heroku. In comparison to a purely client-side list, this has the advantage of appearing on any computer one might access. Currently, there is no privacy to this list. A possible future development could be that there is a sign-in process to only display a single user's list upon receiving specific credentials.

## Usage
Click the 'Get Started' button on the homepage to be navigated to a page where you can maintain a list. Create a title that will be displayed in a list on the left-hand side, as well as a description that will be displayed upon clicking this note. Click the floppy-disk icon in the top right upon entering information in both fields to save the note. It is now possible to view your note by clicking on the title on the left, and it is possible to create a new note by clicking on the pen icon on the top right. Click the trash can icon next to a note to delete it.
